🧮 Simple Arithmetic Calculator
A Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers. ✨

📝 Description
This program takes two numbers as input from the user and computes their:

➕ Sum (num1 + num2)

➖ Difference (num1 - num2)

✖️ Product (num1 * num2)

➗ Quotient (num1 / num2)

The results are displayed in a clear and formatted output. 📊

🌟 Features
✔️ Accepts floating-point numbers (decimals)
✔️ Performs four fundamental arithmetic operations
✔️ Simple and user-friendly interface

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the code in a file, e.g., calculator.py.

Run the program using:

sh
python calculator.py
Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.

View the computed results.

📋 Example Usage
sh
Enter the first number: 10.5  
Enter the second number: 2  

📊 Results of your two numbers:  
➕ Sum: 12.5  
➖ Difference: 8.5  
✖️ Product: 21.0  
➗ Quotient: 5.25  
⚠️ Limitations
🔴 Division by zero will cause an error (not handled in this version).
🔴 Only supports two numbers at a time.

🔧 Possible Enhancements
🛠️ Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).

🔢 Include more operations (e.g., modulus, exponentiation).

🔄 Allow multiple calculations in a loop.
