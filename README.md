Simple Arithmetic Calculator
A Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers.

Description
This program takes two numbers as input from the user and computes their:

Sum (num1 + num2)

Difference (num1 - num2)

Product (num1 * num2)

Quotient (num1 / num2)

The results are displayed in a clear and formatted output.

Features
✔ Accepts floating-point numbers (decimals)
✔ Performs four fundamental arithmetic operations
✔ Simple and user-friendly interface

How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the code in a file, e.g., calculator.py.

Run the program using:

sh
python calculator.py
Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.

View the computed results.

Example Usage
sh
Enter the first number: 10.5  
Enter the second number: 2  

Results of your two numbers:  
Sum: 12.5  
Difference: 8.5  
Product: 21.0  
Quotient: 5.25  
Limitations
⚠ Division by zero will cause an error (not handled in this version).
⚠ Only supports two numbers at a time.

Possible Enhancements
Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).

Include more operations (e.g., modulus, exponentiation).

Allow multiple calculations in a loop.
